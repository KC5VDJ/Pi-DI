The Raspberry Pi Zero W can indeed run full DtCyber, yes.

I feel that doing so is a huge drain on the resources in a typical battry operated application for the Raspberry Pi Zero.

This project will implement the Control Data Cyber Ethernet DI, thus not only allowing the Pi to idle more, but to also have more resources available to the Raspian-Side, for actually doing things.

One selectable Raspian/bsd, CDCNet, or DI Console port, initially, using the standard Pi serial console.

Access to Pi pins and interfaces, with at least compass and ftn5 API.

Access to USB??  Access to Bluetooth??  We'll see!!
